* Geotechnical Report
This is the geotechnical investigation report prepared byy XX which was commissioned by 
Enernet Global. 

1. Site Visit Period: 1 April 2001
1. Site Report 

** Intent

The investigation is intended to provide:

1. Assessment of subsurface soil and groundwater conditions relevant to the project.
1. Recommendations regarding footings where appropriate including
founding depths, skin friction and allowable bearing capacities.
1. Comments regarding subgrade prepareation and construction of
engineered fill.
1. Earth Resisitivity using the Wenner Method.
1. Information on evcavuation condiotions, evacuation stability and excavability.
1. Information regarding the agressivity of the gorund to concrete and
steel foundations.
